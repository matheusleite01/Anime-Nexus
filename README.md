# Overview

Anime nexus is a web app built with React that allows users to search different animes and find out information about them. The application fetches data from the [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe), providing various information such as episodes, popularity, season and more.

The project incorporates a responsive design, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices. The initial design was created using Figma, a popular design tool, to ensure an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive user interface.

# Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe): Data source for anime information.
